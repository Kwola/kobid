# KOBID - Kwola Open Bug Identification Dataset

This repository contains code for pulling, managing, and interacting with the KOBID dataset.

The KOBID dataset is a dataset of codebases that have been bundled in a standardized way
which allows them to be used as environments for a reinforcement learning algorithm.

Think of the KOBID dataset as being similar to the OpenAI Gym ( https://gym.openai.com/ ),
except specifically built for bug-hunting algorithms.
