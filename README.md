# KROS - Kwola Regular Old Software Dataset

This repository contains code for pulling, managing, and interacting with the KROS dataset.

The KROS dataset is a dataset of codebases that have been bundled in a standardized way
which allows them to be used as environments for a reinforcement learning algorithm.

Think of the KROS dataset as being similar to the OpenAI Gym ( https://gym.openai.com/ ),
except specifically built for bug-hunting algorithms.
